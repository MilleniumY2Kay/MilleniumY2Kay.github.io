		In the text, Berger argues the interesting idea that the original work of an artist has wholly separate meaning from any other reproductions of said work. Viewing a painting, static and on your time discretion, is the truest form to perceive a work. When the art is translated to a different medium, such as made into a short clip within a film, the director of the film warps the meaning of the art to fit the goals of his film. Berger does make it clear that this doesn’t devalue the work perse. In fact expanding upon a work with the help of our own experiences can enrich the piece.

		I think this is an idea that I agree with, and is something that I often see in the “life cycle” of memes on social media. The original work, a meme can be altered in so many ways that transform and sometimes flip the meaning of the meme on its head. I think one of the most subtle examples of this is the explosion of “cropped images” on social media sites like Twitter. Users often take memes, usually old or “dead” memes that are no longer considered funny, and crop out certain details that warp the meaning in such absurd ways that it gives the meme “new life”.

	<p>For example, this image above is a pretty stereotypical, lame facebook meme. In its original form, this image can be interpreted as an (incredibly corny) display of machismo. But what happens when we just slightly crop this image?</p>

	<p> Now, this picture goes from an eye-roll-inducing performance of bravado to a ridiculous, funny, incomplete statement. This image goes from communicating the creator’s “capacity of violence or cruelty”, to communicating a disinterest in anything. It also feels much more relevant to most people today, as the pandemic has depleted most people’s motivation to work or appease other obligations. This edit is seen much more frequently online than the original because of this.</p>
