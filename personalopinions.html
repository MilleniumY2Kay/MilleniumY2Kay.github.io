	<p class="bio"> I think the concept of this installation is brilliant. An interest or fascination is almost surely instilled in all of us WebDev students, and just about anybody who intentionally leans into technology more so than is already mandated by the way the world is currently functioning. Personally, I've acknowledged this fascination of "cool computer stuff," and even embraced it, all without questioning what exactly was so intriguing to me about it all. This exhibition by Samuel Adam Swope and Fito Segrera awakes a new mystery in its audience by subjecting their own technological interests or passions to a deep analysis. This artistic feat was certainly accomplished by the installation of somewhat non-functional, technologically "enhanced" household objects, making them fly around on quadcopters equipped with automated sensors. It's an exaggerated mockery of society's longing for the next big tech breakthrough, the flying car, the hoverboard, the future that is so sought after for whatever reason. However, since we could only see the advertisements for the installation, apparently those images were striking enough to accomplish the same thing as the installation might have if we had attended it IRL. The futurist-inspired 3D art is a little more abstract, and probably couldn't convey too specific of a message on its own, but the last image in the article, containing text that spells out the phrase, "JUST WHAT MAKES TODAY'S COMPUTERS SO INTRIGUING... SO NONSENSICAL," is what hit me the hardest.</p>
